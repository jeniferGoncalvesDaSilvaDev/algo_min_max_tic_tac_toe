I will iterate through these experiments, call the `train_q_agents` function for each, and store the results.

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The chess environment was successfully set up using the `python-chess` library, allowing for board initialization and move manipulation.\n",
        "*   Four core feature extraction functions were developed and integrated into a single `extract_features` function: `get_material_advantage`, `get_pawn_structure_features` (including isolated, doubled, and passed pawns), `get_king_safety_features`, and `get_piece_activity_features`. Initial implementation issues related to FEN strings and API usage were debugged.\n",
        "*   A heuristic `evaluate_board` function was implemented, combining the extracted features with predefined `sample_weights`. This function correctly provides a score for a given board state, adjusted for the current player's perspective.\n",
        "*   The Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning was implemented within a `find_best_move` function, utilizing the heuristic evaluation. It successfully identified optimal moves for various scenarios, including a mate-in-1 position.\n",
        "*   A `QAgent` class was designed, incorporating an epsilon-greedy strategy for move selection (balancing exploration with Minimax-based exploitation) and a weight update mechanism based on the Q-learning rule.\n",
        "*   A Q-learning training loop was executed for 50 episodes, where two `QAgent` instances played against each other.\n",
        "    *   Over 50 episodes, the White agent's win rate improved from an initial ~20% to 30.00%, while the Black agent's win rate decreased from ~30% to 20.00%. Draws remained a significant outcome, accounting for 50% to 56.67% of games.\n",
        "    *   The agents' weights showed significant adjustments during training. The White agent's weights, in particular, displayed extreme values for features like `king_safety` (10.0) and `piece_activity` (-10.0), indicating an aggressive learning towards these aspects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current Q-learning setup with limited episodes (50) and Minimax depth (1) shows rudimentary learning, with one agent gaining a slight edge. Increasing the number of training episodes and the Minimax search depth could significantly enhance agent performance and lead to more complex strategies.\n",
        "*   The dramatic shifts and clipping of weights suggest that the initial `sample_weights`, learning rates, or the feature set itself might need refinement. Future work could involve hyperparameter tuning for learning rate, discount factor, and exploration decay, or adding more nuanced features (e.g., control of specific squares, piece mobility beyond legal moves, threat assessment) to prevent feature values from hitting hard limits too quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Refinement: Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reasoning**:\n",
        "To refine the Q-learning agents, I will implement a function to conduct hyperparameter tuning. This function will allow us to experiment with different combinations of `learning_rate`, `discount_factor`, and `exploration_rate` to find a configuration that leads to better and more stable learning. I will also increase the `minimax_depth` to allow the agents to 'look ahead' further in the game, potentially improving their strategic play. I will then run a set of experiments and compare the results to identify optimal parameters."

        "*   The chess environment was successfully set up using the `python-chess` library, allowing for board initialization and move manipulation.\n",
        "*   Four core feature extraction functions were developed and integrated into a single `extract_features` function: `get_material_advantage`, `get_pawn_structure_features` (including isolated, doubled, and passed pawns), `get_king_safety_features`, and `get_piece_activity_features`. Initial implementation issues related to FEN strings and API usage were debugged.\n",
        "*   A heuristic `evaluate_board` function was implemented, combining the extracted features with predefined `sample_weights`. This function correctly provides a score for a given board state, adjusted for the current player's perspective.\n",
        "*   The Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning was implemented within a `find_best_move` function, utilizing the heuristic evaluation. It successfully identified optimal moves for various scenarios, including a mate-in-1 position.\n",
        "*   A `QAgent` class was designed, incorporating an epsilon-greedy strategy for move selection (balancing exploration with Minimax-based exploitation) and a weight update mechanism based on the Q-learning rule.\n",
        "*   A Q-learning training loop was executed for 50 episodes, where two `QAgent` instances played against each other.\n",
        "    *   Over 50 episodes, the White agent's win rate improved from an initial ~20% to 30.00%, while the Black agent's win rate decreased from ~30% to 20.00%. Draws remained a significant outcome, accounting for 50% to 56.67% of games.\n",
        "    *   The agents' weights showed significant adjustments during training. The White agent's weights, in particular, displayed extreme values for features like `king_safety` (10.0) and `piece_activity` (-10.0), indicating an aggressive learning towards these aspects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current Q-learning setup with limited episodes (50) and Minimax depth (1) shows rudimentary learning, with one agent gaining a slight edge. Increasing the number of training episodes and the Minimax search depth could significantly enhance agent performance and lead to more complex strategies.\n",
        "*   The dramatic shifts and clipping of weights suggest that the initial `sample_weights`, learning rates, or the feature set itself might need refinement. Future work could involve hyperparameter tuning for learning rate, discount factor, and exploration decay, or adding more nuanced features (e.g., control of specific squares, piece mobility beyond legal moves, threat assessment) to prevent feature values from hitting hard limits too quickly.\n"
